# AI_CHATBOT
This repository contains code for a chatbot with intent recognition. The chatbot is built using the Keras library and trained on a dataset of intents defined in a JSON file. It utilizes natural language processing techniques and a neural network model to understand user input and provide appropriate responses based on the predicted intent.
